# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Deep-learning-models

The latest Nilson report estimates that in 2016, worldwide credit card losses topped $24.71 billion. Barclays reports that 47% of all credit card fraud occurs in the United States. It is important that credit card companies should able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. This can be achieved with help of machine learning models specifically deep learnings frameworks.

For the limitation of this post, we are considering two Deep learning frameworks called:-

a) Autoencoder

b) Self-organizing-maps (SOM’s)

We will explore as to how we can use this framework to detect fraudulent transaction from the given dataset.

The datasets contain transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are ‘Time’ and ‘Amount’. Feature ‘Time’ contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
